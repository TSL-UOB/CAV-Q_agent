# CAV-Qagent
This is an extension of the previous work on agency-directed test generation, see https://github.com/TSL-UOB/CAV-MAS. In this work an additional agent is included in the analysis of test genration for an autonomous driving scenario, where interesting tests are generated more readily than with random methods.
